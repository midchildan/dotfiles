# Overlays

This directory contains Nixpkgs [overlays][overlays], which are Nix expressions
that can extend and modify the Nixpkgs package set. Compared to conventional
package managers, making changes to an existing package is a trivial task that
can be accomplished in very few lines of code. Overlays are a convenient way to
test out new changes and fixes earlier.
