# dotfiles

dotfiles for my personal use.

[![Build][build-badge]][build-url]

## Requirements

### Nix Package Manager (>= 2.4)

Consult the following for more details.

- [Official website](https://nixos.org)
- [Official docs](https://nixos.org/learn.html)

It's also possible to use this dotfiles on systems without Nix, albeit with
reduced compatibility guarantees. If you wish to do so, make sure to read
[this document](home/README.md) before proceeding.

## Installation

### Step 1: Preparation

#### With Nix

Drop into a [nix-shell][nix-shell] with the following command. This would
download some commands required for setup, open a new temporary shell, and make
the commands available through `PATH`.

```console
$ system="$(nix-instantiate --eval -E 'builtins.currentSystem' | tr -d '"')"
$ nix-shell -A "devShells.$system.setup" 'https://github.com/midchildan/dotfiles/archive/master.tar.gz'
$
```

#### Without Nix

Make sure the following commands are installed beforehand.

- Git
- cURL or Wget
- Neovim

Neovim is used to install Vim plugins at the end of the installation. If you
wish to use Vim instead, you can do so manually by invoking
[`:PlugInstall`][plug] in Vim.

### Step 2: Setup your repository

Fork this repository and clone it to your location of choice. Then edit
`config.toml` and commit the changes.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/${USER}/dotfiles.git ~/Documents/src/repos/github.com/${USER}/dotfiles
$ cd ~/Documents/src/repos/github.com/${USER}/dotfiles
$ nvim config.toml
$ git commit -am 'chore: adjust config.toml for my own use'
```

### Step 3: Checkout the relevant branch

Using the table in the [Supported Platforms](#supported-platforms) section,
checkout the most relevant branch for your platform. Note that instead of
checking out your chosen branch directly, it is recommended that you create a
`local` branch based on your chosen branch that is tied to your local machine
and check it out to a separate path for deployment. This way, you can make edits
on any branch without affecting your current configuration.

```console
$ git branch --track local  # create local branch
$ git worktree add ~/.config/dotfiles local  # checkout local branch
```

### Step 4: Symlink dotfiles

Run the setup script. This script would symlink files in
[home/files](home/files) to your home directory. It should be run each time
changes are made to your dotfiles even after bootstrapping is complete. The
`--init` flag indicates that this is the first time you've run this script.

```console
$ ./setup.sh --init
```

If you're using Nix, proceed to the next step. Otherwise, bootstrapping is
complete.

### Step 5: Bootstrap NixOS / Nix-Darwin / Home Manager Configuration

For details about each, read the docs linked below. Pick the ones you need and
configure them as needed before proceeding.

| Software     | File                                 | Required? |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Home Manager | [home/README.md](home/README.md)     | yes       |
| NixOS        | [nixos/README.md](nixos/README.md)   | no        |
| Nix-Darwin   | [darwin/README.md](darwin/README.md) | no        |

Bootstrapping instructions for each are listed below. Home Manager can
optionally be integrated into NixOS or Nix-Darwin. If you do this, NixOS or
Nix-Darwin would take care of bootstrapping Home Manager. Otherwise if you're
bootstrapping Home Manager yourself, make sure [Nix flakes][flakes] are enabled
beforehand.

- Home Manager:

```console
$ nix run '.#home' -- switch --flake .
```

- NixOS:

```console
$ sudo nix --experimental-features 'nix-command flake' run '.#nixos' -- switch --flake '.#'
```

- nix-darwin:

```console
$ mkdir ~/Applications # https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/pull/226
$ nix --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' run '.#darwin' -- switch --flake '.#'
$ sudo -H nix-env -e '*' # remove existing packages not managed by nix-darwin
```

## Supported platforms

| branch | platform |
| ------ | -------- |
| master | Linux    |
| osx    | macOS    |

In addition to the platforms listed above, support for one-off remote Linux
sessions is included in the `gh-pages` branch. This is useful in cases where
it's cumbersome to maintain a full-blown dotfiles, e.g. docker sessions, servers
you rarely login to directly, etc. Notably, this branch doesn't require Nix. See
[here](https://www.midchildan.org/dotfiles) for details.

Changes common to all platforms should first be made in `master`, and then
merged into the remaining branches. Make sure you never go the other way and
merge non-`master` branches into `master` or you'll end up with non-common
platform-specific stuff in `master`.
